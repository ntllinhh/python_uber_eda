# Uber Data Analysis ðŸš–ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores ride-hailing platform data to uncover key patterns in booking behaviour, cancellations, ratings, payments, and demand trends.  
The analysis was performed in **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** using Jupyter Notebook.  

The goal is to identify business insights and provide actionable recommendations for improving customer experience, driver retention, and overall operational efficiency.

## ðŸ—‚ Dataset
- Source: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yashdevladdha/uber-ride-analytics-dashboard/data)
- Key columns include:  
  - **Booking Status** (Completed, Cancelled, Incomplete)
  - **Booking Value**  
  - **Ride Distance, Avg CTAT, Avg VTAT**  
  - **Driver & Customer Ratings**  
  - **Payment Method**  
  - **Cancellation Reasons**  
  - **Vehicle Type**  
  - **Pickup/Drop-off Location**

## ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaways
- **High Service Quality:** Both drivers and customers rate rides highly (avg. >4.2).  
- **Driver Cancellations Dominate:** 72% of cancellations come from drivers, suggesting deeper operational issues.  
- **Demand is Seasonal:** Monthly rides fluctuate heavily, while weekly demand remains stable.  
- **Evening Rush Hour Critical:** Peak demand occurs 4â€“9 PM, making it the most important window for pricing & driver allocation.  
- **Digital Payments Dominant:** UPI is the most popular payment method, showing strong digital adoption.

## ðŸ’¡ Business Recommendations
- **Reduce Driver Cancellations:** Investigate pickup mismatches, low incentives, and safety concerns to improve reliability.  
- **Enhance Address Validation:** Improve in-app input accuracy to cut down customer cancellations.  
- **Driver Experience Program:** Since driver ratings lag slightly behind customer ratings, address driver friction points (e.g., incentive fairness, safety).  
- **Fleet Reliability:** Implement stricter vehicle maintenance checks to reduce incomplete rides caused by breakdowns.  
- **Peak-Hour Strategy:** Increase driver incentives during 4â€“9 PM to meet high demand and maximize revenue.
